To be completely honest, there is not a lot going on it my preview.  I have written out the title and began working on the homepage.  I spent a lot of time picking out possible colors and scanning the web for photos to use.  Moving forward, I need to get quotes from some of my friends who use to or still work for Disney.  I also need to write about my experiences and put them into Atom.  Furthermore, I need to work towards making the site pretty.  I have a pretty clear visual in my head of what I would like it to look like, it is just a matter of understanding the software and making my visual come to life. As on right now, I do not feel like I have any outstanding questions.  The tutorials are extremely helpful, there is just a ton of information packed into each one.  Even though I know there are ways to do what I am picturing, I need to go back and reference the tutorials to review the steps on how to make it possible. I am planning on dedicating a lot of time over the weekend to improve this project.  I'd like for this to be something I can actually direct people to when they ask me questions about working at Disney.
