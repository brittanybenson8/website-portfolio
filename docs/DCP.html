    <h2>The Disney College Program</h2>

    <h3>What is the Disney College Program?</h3>

    <p>The Disney College Program is an internship program sponsored by The Walt Disney Company that allows college students and recent graduates to gain valuable, on-the-job experience working in Disney parks and resorts.

    <h3>What are the requirements?</h3>

    <p>The only requirement is to be enrolled in college or a recent grad.  You can apply for the program up until a year after you graduate.</p>

    <h3>How long is the program?</h3>

    <p>Programs range in amount of time spent there based on when you are applying for.  These are the options offered for the Walt Disney World College Program.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spring - Mid January to mid May</li>
      <li>Spring Advantage - Mid Janurary to mid August</li>
      <li>Summer - Mid May to mid August - Summer programs are only open to Disney College Program Alumni</li>
      <li>Fall Advantage - Mid May to early January</li>
      <li>Fall - Mid August to early January</li>
    </ul>

    <p> </p>

    <h3>Can I stay longer?</h3>

    <p>Yes, all participants are elligible to apply to extend their program up until a full year.</p>
    <p>For example, say you are a Fall DCP Participant.  You could extend your program for the following Spring.  Then, if you wanted to, you could extend again into the Summer.  But, you could not extend into the Fall again because you would pass a year.</p>
