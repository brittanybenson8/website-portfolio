    <h1>Discovering Disney</h1>

    <h2>Vacation Tips</h2>

    <p>Here is a list of tips and tricks that were learned from living and working in Disney World.  Hopefully, these will allow for your trip to run as smoothly as possible.</p>

    <h3>FastPass+</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>FastPass+ is included in your park ticket and open to all guests.</li>
      <li>FastPasses give you a one hour time slot that allows you to skip the line on select attractions.</li>
      <li>Each guest is allowed to make 3 FastPasses in advance for a select day.</li>
      <li>After your 3 FastPasses are used, you can make another one.  Once that fourth one is used, you can make a fifth one and so on.</li>
      <li>To make the most out of you time, make your FastPasses as early in the morning as you can, that way you can continue to make more throughout the day.</li>
      <li>There is a 10 minute grace period before and after your time slot.  For example, if your FastPass is from 12:30-1:30, you can really get on the ride from 12:20-1:30, so don't worry if you're running late.</li>
      <li>After making FastPasses, you are able to modify them.  Sometimes, it pays off to select a FastPass and then modify it through MDE (mentioned below).  Usually, once you are modifying it, better time options and FastPass selections will pop up.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My Disney Experience</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>My Disney Experience (MDE) is an app that allows you to make FastPasses and Dining Reservations.  It also allows you to see your PhotoPass Photos and check in on your hotel reservation.  The app lists wait times for every attraction in the park along with show times, character appearance schedules, and nearby places to eat.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend downloading this app before your vacation and getting use to it.</li>
      <li>Knowing how to navigate MDE gives you the best chance at getting good FastPasses and Dining Reservations.</li>
      <li>This app can be linked with other members of your party that way you can make your travel plans together.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Dining Reservations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It is recommended to make dining reservations well before your trip.  Reservations open up 6 months in advanced.</li>
      <li>Sometimes, this is not always the option.</li>
      <li>A lot of the time, reservations pop up the night before or the day of.</li>
      <li>You have until midnight the night before your reservation to cancel without a fee, therefore, at around 9-11 o'clock at night, many reservations for the next day will appear.</li>
      <li>If there is a restaurant you'd like to get a reservation for but missed your chance, definitely monitor MDE before going to bed and the next morning./li>
      <li>Just like with FastPasses, by using MDE it modify a reservation, more locations and time slots will pop up.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You never have to buy bottled water at Disney.  Every food location with a fountain drink dispenser will give out free cups of water.  This can save you a lot of money.</li>
      <li>Get to the firework/nighttime shows early.  Spots for them fill up quickly, and trust me, you'll want a good one.  Also, at the end of the night, it will feel good to take a break and sit for a while.</li>
      <li>Get to the parks about 15-30 minutes before they open.  This will allow you to be some of the first people to enter the park.  For there go to rides that usually have a long line for, but that you don't have a FastPass for.  Most people don't think to ride Tower of Terror at 9:00 AM, so if your stomache can handle it, you'll get on and off the ride very quickly.</li>
      <li>Use Photopass.  They have different picture packages and PhotoPass Photographers are located all over the parks.  It also include pictures of you taken while on the rides.  Their professional cameras will give you better quality photos than an iPhone will.</li>
      <li>There are some long attractions that allow you to sit in air conditioning for a while and take a break.  Use these when you are tired.  Some include: Carousel of Progress, Country Bear Jamboree, Spaceship Earth, and Hall of Presidents.</li>
    </ul>
